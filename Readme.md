# Get Weather App

A project in React that is taking the user location and shows the weather in that location. The user will find out what is the description of the weather, the humidity, chances of rain, wind, temperature and he will also be able to change the temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsiuse.

## Extra info:

All the routes are created at the top level component `<App />`
To style the project I have used Styled Components, the styling being secondary in importance to the features.
This was a good learning opportunity as I created the first React Project calling an API call, I have also used a Higher-Order Component and I have also tested my project for the first time .

#### Testing
console.log(wrapper.debug()); - print a wrapper react component in the terminal; while running Jest
git commit --amend - changes the git commit message
